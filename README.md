## Cryptography-Exercises
This project contains C# solutions of three exercises on cryptography.

## Exercise 1 (CryptoPaillier).
Given the encrypted votes of 1000 voters, determine the result of the election by utilizing Paillier homomorphic cryptosystem. Paillier public and private keys are provided. 

The full problem description and input values can be found in "/src/CryptoPaillier/15_PaillierVote_Question.txt". 

This exercise is an example of how homomorphic properties of the Paillier cryptosystem can be used for the implementaion of a secure electronic voting.

## Exercise 2 (RSA 1)
You have obtained the information from a password distribution centre that has just sent out a password in the form of a number made up of eight two digit ASCII representation of uppercase letters. The password was sent to three recipients. Each recipient is using unpadded RSA with public key values of 3 but different n values. Recover the password without factoring any of the n values.

The full problem description and input values can be found in "/src/RSA1/TaskDescription.txt".


## Exercise 3 (RSA 2)
Consider the following two RSA public keys 
(n,e1) and (n,e2). They have been used to encrypt a password made up of four two digit ascii reperesentations to produce ciphertexts c1 and c2 respectively. Recover the password.

The full problem description and input values can be found in "/src/RSA2/TaskDescription.txt".
